# Software_Analysis_and_Design
 This repository contains programs from my class about designing software in C#. In this class, I am looking more in depth at object oriented principles, understanding how to make code cleaner and maintainable, and eventually will look at a few software design patterns. Programs in this repository include:

Midterm Problems - Two problems were completed in an hour and 45 minutes. One problem involved association (aggregation) while the other used abstraction.

Homework Problems (additions will be made) - Currently has one problem that deals with locating a student from a bunch of student records. The problem uses abstraction and aggregation. Parsing the file and the data structure used in storing the student information was key in solving this problem correctly.
