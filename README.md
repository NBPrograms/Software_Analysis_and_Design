# Software_Analysis_and_Design
 This repository contains programs from my class about designing software in C#. In this class, I am looking more in depth at object oriented principles, understanding how to make code cleaner and maintainable, and learning a few software design patterns. Programs in this repository include:

Midterm Problems - Two problems were completed in an hour and 45 minutes. One problem involved association (aggregation) while the other used abstraction.

Homework Problems (2) - The first problem that deals with locating a student from a bunch of student records. The problem uses abstraction and aggregation. Parsing the file and the data structure used in storing the student information was key in solving this problem correctly. The second problem is a scoring system that designates winners for individual competitions as well as the overall competition. There are multiple instances of inheritance, abstraction, and association in this problem. Organizing the information in a dictionary, sorting the information, and using the strategy pattern helped in solving this problem.
